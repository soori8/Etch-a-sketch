# Etch-a-sketch
sketchPad(mini-Jquery-project)
The idea of project is for [OdinProject](http://www.theodinproject.com/). and i will be happy to correct me on my exercise mini Project.

You can see the preview of project here on [Github](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/soori8/Etch-a-sketch/blob/master/index.html).

Its a Sketch pad tools with these features:
- You can change the grid system and size of the sketch pad
- you change change the color of pen between RED, GREEN, BLUE, COLORFULL
- you can change the style of pen between SIMPLE, TRAIL, OPACITY
- above of the sketch pad has a status area that shows your controll option before you start to drawing
- it's not responsive and will be run in large Screens (maybe come back and fix this issue in the future)
